Level 1:
Just lots of dasher drones and debris out in deep space



Level 2:
Dasher drones and a couple of Solarin fighters
Setting: some planet? Do we want to do the volcanic planet from the concept document or some other one?
If we chose a planet - gravity will work



Level 3: other planet
More solarin fighters and a couple of drones
Introduce bombers (since gravity will work here)



Level 4:
Deep space
Solarin fighters mainly -- heavy debris




Level 5:  spaceship base
Think: attacking the death star
Lots of solarin fighters, and ground artillery



Level 6: boss
